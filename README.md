## Automated Messages Analysis

In today's fast-paced work environment, professionals often find themselves juggling multiple communication platforms such as Gmail, Slack, Jira, Microsoft Teams, Asana, and Discord. Managing messages across these various apps can be overwhelming and time-consuming, leading to missed updates, issues, and meetings.

My project, Automated Messages Analysis, addresses this challenge by providing a unified solution. This innovative application aggregates messages from all your communication platforms into one centralized interface. With a single click, users receive a summarized overview of their messages, complete with clear headings and concise summaries.

Currently, this is just a prototype designed to demonstrate the proof of concept (POC). It uses hardcoded messages from different platforms to showcase how the final product will function.

Key Features:

1. Centralized Message Aggregation: Collects messages from multiple apps into one place.
2. One-Click Summarization: Provides an instant summary of all messages.
3. Concise Overviews: Generates clear headings and brief descriptions for each message.
4. Time-Saving: Reduces the need to navigate through multiple applications.
